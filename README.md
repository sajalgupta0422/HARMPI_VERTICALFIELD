HARM  version 1.0   (released May 1, 2006)

 This file is part of HARM.  HARM is a program that solves hyperbolic 
    partial differential equations in conservative form using high-resolution
    shock-capturing techniques.  This version of HARM has been configured to 
    solve the relativistic magnetohydrodynamic equations of motion on a 
    stationary black hole spacetime in Kerr-Schild coordinates to evolve
    an accretion disk model. 

You are morally obligated to cite the following two papers in his/her 
    scientific literature that results from use of any part of HARM:
